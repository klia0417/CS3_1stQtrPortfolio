# Q1 End of Lessons Reflections
## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.
1. **Assignment Operators** - I can use `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, and `/=` properly when updating variable values. For example, `x += 2` feels efficient compared to writing `x = x + 2`. They make code shorter and easier to read, which I find very convenient.
2. **Comparison Operators** - These operators compare two values and return a Boolean result (`true` or `false`). Examples are `==`, `===`, `!=`, `>`, and `<`. I became confident in using them because they are useful in `if` statements and conditions, like checking if a number is greater than another. I learned that `===` is stricter than `==` since it also checks the type, which helps avoid errors in code.
3. **Using let and const** - I learned how to declare variables using `let` and `const`. `let` allows me to change the value later, while `const` is used when the value should not change. This topic was clear to me because we compared it directly with `var` and discussed why let and const are safer to use. I found it easy to remember because of the practice exercises where I had to choose the correct declaration.
4. **Output in the Console** - Using `console.log()` helped me see the result of my JavaScript code directly in the browser’s developer tools. This is something I really understood well because I used it almost every time I wanted to test my code. It is especially helpful for debugging since I can check if variables and calculations are working properly. I rely on the console a lot because it’s the fastest way to check what’s happening in my program.
5. **Difference Between Declarations and Expressions** – I learned that function declarations are hoisted, meaning they can be called before being written. Function expressions are not hoisted, so they must be defined first. This difference helps me choose which one to use.

## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why. The why should be per topic listed.
1. **Logical Operators** – I know that logical operators like `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), and `!` (NOT) are used for combining conditions. However, I sometimes get confused when conditions become more complex, like mixing multiple `&&` and `||` in one statement. I need more practice to clearly see how the logic flows.
2. **Alert Dialog Boxes** – I know that alerts display messages in a pop-up window and are useful for quickly notifying users. While I can create an alert, I rarely use it compared to `console.log()` or inserting text into an HTML element. I am still unsure of the best situations where alerts are appropriate.
3. **Loops** - Loops let me repeat code without writing it many times. I know how to use `for` loops to go through numbers or items in an array, and `while` loops when I want the code to keep running until a condition is false. Sometimes I still forget when to use `for` versus `while`, or I accidentally make an infinite loop by not updating the condition.
4. **Switch Statements** - A switch statement helps me choose between many possible options without writing a long chain of `if...else` conditions. I know it checks the value of a variable and runs the matching case, which makes code easier to read. Sometimes I forget to put the `break` statement, so it continues to the next case even when it’s not needed.
5. **Boolean** - Booleans are values that can only be `true` or `false`. I use them in conditions to decide what the program should do. Sometimes I get confused with “truthy” and “falsy” values, like `0` or `""`, which count as `false`. With more practice, I can use Booleans correctly in my code.

## Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
1. **Logical Operators** - I will ask more questions in class or from classmates when conditions look confusing. Watching example problems being solved will also help me see how the logic flows.
2. **Alert Dialog Boxes** - I will try using alerts in mini coding tasks as practice to see when they are useful. Comparing them with `console.log()` will help me know when to use each one.
3. **Loops** - I will try solving coding challenges that use loops, but also review step-by-step explanations. Seeing how loops run one line at a time will make them easier for me to understand.
4. **Switch Statements** - I will pay closer attention to where I forget `break` and review examples in my notes. Asking for feedback on my code will also help me spot mistakes faster.
5. **Boolean** - I will make a simple list of truthy and falsy values as a quick reference. Keeping it in my notes will help me remember them while coding.

## In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
1. **Effective**
   * Coding Exercises - Doing hands-on coding exercises helped me apply what we learned right away. Writing actual code and testing it in the browser made me understand concepts better than just reading about them. It also showed me where I was making mistakes so I could fix them quickly.
   * Group Work - Working with classmates on small coding challenges was helpful because we could share ideas and explain topics to each other. Sometimes my classmates explained things in a way that was easier for me to understand. This made learning less stressful and more fun.
2. **Not Effective**
   * I feel like the whole course and the activities that were done in class were really effective because all the activities helped me understand JavaScript better. The coding exercises were effective since they made me practice right away. I also found the demonstrations helpful because everything was explained step by step. Honestly, nothing felt less or not effective because everything we did added to my understanding in some way.
